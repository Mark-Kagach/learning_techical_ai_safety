# My Solutions to Exercises and Notebooks from the Hands-on ML book.

Hands on ML is my first serious resource for learning ML (besides a few other things I've tried, like completing basic ML course at uni, and doing half of Andrew Ng's ML spec on coursera).

## The long-term goal is to: Master ML techniques to solve real-world problems; with deep theoretical understanding to conduct research in a chosen niche.

In learning ML I follow a simple algorithm:
1. Understand
2. Explain
3. Apply
4. Remember

The 3rd part of my learning for Hands-on ML book is documented below.

I do not look up the answers, and treat exercises and notebooks as __real tests__. I skip some exercises if I don't think they're a good use of my time.

After each exercise I grade myself right away with a traffic light: 🔴🟡🟢. 
And put the correct answer after the 🅰️ symbol.
For some exercises I reflect (write feedback) after the ➡️ symbol.

The point of grading is to give myself cues of what I should practice more.

Red means failure, yellow usually means correct but was hard (or partially correct), while green means entirely correct or good enough.
