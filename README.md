# AI/ML Self-Education

## The goal is to master AI/ML to solve advanced real-world problems; with deep theoretical understanding to conduct research in a chosen niche.

As of September 2025, this is translated into two specific goals:
1. Solve an advanced real problem with frontier AI/ML techniques (e.g. winning a hackathon, or personal project). For details see level 3-4 project [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx4BYXOE9SQ&t=186s).
2. Generate a novel AI/ML research idea, implement and communicate it (e.g. writing a paper, or big essay). 

## Solution
The solution is **consistent [deliberate practice](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0544947223/)**. It is divided into [theoretical](https://github.com/Mark-Kagach/learning_ml/tree/24fe7c69d1fcb40b3a853f8659e0e7caa4388e28/Theoretical%20Practice) and [technical](https://github.com/Mark-Kagach/learning_ml/tree/24fe7c69d1fcb40b3a853f8659e0e7caa4388e28/Technical%20Practice) parts. This repository is a practice camp for improving my AI/ML craft.

I publish this because, besides the value of signaling, I work better under public accountability.

Below I describe my learning approach and some additional details. 

### Learning Algorithm
1. **Understand** important concepts, techniques.
2. **Explain** them in my own words (usually means making notes/ flashcards).
3. **Apply** techniques (for concepts generate examples and see how theory plays out).
4. **Remember** both. Theory through flashcards and feynman lessons, practice through consistent exercises (and big projects in the long-run).

[Theoretical practice](https://github.com/Mark-Kagach/learning_ml/tree/24fe7c69d1fcb40b3a853f8659e0e7caa4388e28/Theoretical%20Practice) is mainly divided into uploading my flashcard practices and [feynman lessons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f-qkGJBPts) explaining whatever important concepts I'm trying to learn.

Whereas [technical practice](https://github.com/Mark-Kagach/learning_ml/tree/24fe7c69d1fcb40b3a853f8659e0e7caa4388e28/Technical%20Practice) is either Kaggle competitions, exercises from textbooks (e.g. Hands-on ML book by Geron Aurelien) or other random sources. As I mature in my skill I'll focus more on completing longer complex projects.

### Details
The main idea is to treat AI/ML and my training of it with similar attitude as professional athletes treat their [practices](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1V1b314FLv4bn0KbauqvUa?si=dF9lIgVwTFWTmyyWRURUEA&t=4599). (Here are the main books I used to understand what good practice is: Peak, The Art of Learning, Get better at anything, and Ultralearning.)

I also try to heavily triage what I consider relevant theory and techniques to practice based on my goals. (For example, if you want to be an alignment researcher, unlikely you need to know cutting edge computer vision techniques.)

Some of my previous ML work was: doing CS50ai, Andrew Ng's ML Specialialization, and a personal project of making a Paul Graham RAG and connecting it to MCP.

**Sep 2025**
- W36: Created Paul Graham MCP/ RAG: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWfr8tkJUhA
- W37: Was doing ML Specialization by Andrew Ng.
- W38: Found it to be too spiky and unfitting for my learning goals, switched to practicing basic Kaggle datasets on my own and Hands-On Machine Learning book.
- W39: Continued with Kaggle datasets and Hands-on Machine Learning.
- W40: Mostly self-studying ML concepts, explaining them and revisiting past things with flashcards.

**Oct 2025**
- W41: Spend most of the time prepping for Coefficient Giving grant (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMv7pOzPKs), wrote My Evolving Almanack (https://markkagach.substack.com/s/my-evolving-almanack).
- W42: Started working on the AAAA Hackathon: https://www.hackaging.ai
- W43: Won AAAA with Elias ($2,500): https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nicholas-gentry-phd_menopause-later-activity-7390066766556856320-EjUN/ https://github.com/EliasSchlie/quantifying-the-value-of-delayed-ovarian-aging
- W44: Mainly was writing proposal for Coefficient Giving, and mini burn-out❤️.

**Nov 2025**
- W45: Mostly family travel.
- W46: Mostly family travel.
- W47: Finally submitted that lovely Coefficient Giving grant: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMv7pOzPKs
- W48: Revisited main explanations of computers, ML, and developed framework for differentiating implicit and explicit coding. Wanted to get fundamentals and big picture really right.

**Dec 2025**
- W49: Continued focus on mental models that explain big picture of AI and ML. Read first two chapters of AI Modern approach (80 pages). Now focused on having a broad overview of all AI subfields from the book but ML, DL, RL. (Those I'll explore deeply next.)
