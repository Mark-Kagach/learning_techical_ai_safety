This is my training camp where I practice and improve my machine learning craft.

## The Goal is to: Master ML to solve advanced real-world problems; with deep theoretical understanding to conduct research in a chosen niche.

As of September 2025, this is translated into two specific goals:
1. Solve an advanced real problem with frontier ML techniques (e.g. winning a hackathon, or personal project). For details see level 3-4 project [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx4BYXOE9SQ&t=186s).
2. Generate a novel ML research idea, implement and communicate it (e.g. writing a paper, or big essay). 

## Solution
Before going into any detail, I'll describe my learning algorithm and two currently relevant folders to it.

### Learning Algorithm
1. Understand important concepts, techniques.
2. Explain them in my own words (usually means making notes/ flashcards).
3. Apply techniques (for concepts generate examples and see how theory plays out).
4. Remember both. Theory through flashcards and feynman lessons, practice through consistent exercises (and big projects in the long-run).

### Relevant Folders
Right now, the two folders I'm focused on are: 
1. [Feynman Explanations and Flashcard Practice]([url](https://github.com/Mark-Kagach/learning_ml/tree/main/Feynman%20Explanations%20and%20Flashcards%20Practice)) is where I upload my ≈daily flashcard practices and [feynman lessons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f-qkGJBPts) explaining whatever important concepts I'm trying to learn.
2. [Hands-on ML Book Practice]([url](https://github.com/Mark-Kagach/learning_ml/tree/main/Hands-on%20ML%20Book%20Practice)) is where I practice ML techniques through execrises of Hands-on ML book by Geron Aurelien.

### Details
All of this is public because I want to show __consistency and seriousness__ I apply to getting better at ML (I also perform better with public accountability).

The main idea is to treat ML and my training of it with similar attitude as professional athletes treat their [practices](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1V1b314FLv4bn0KbauqvUa?si=dF9lIgVwTFWTmyyWRURUEA&t=4599). (Here are the main books I used to understand what good practice is: Peak, The Art of Learning, Get better at anything, and Ultralearning.)

I also try to heavily triage what I consider relevant theory and techniques to practice based on my goals. (For example, if you want to be an alignment researcher, unlikely you need to know cutting edge computer vision techniques.)

Some of my previous ML work was: doing CS50ai, Andrew Ng's ML Specialialization, and a personal project of making a paul graham RAG and connecting it to MCP.
