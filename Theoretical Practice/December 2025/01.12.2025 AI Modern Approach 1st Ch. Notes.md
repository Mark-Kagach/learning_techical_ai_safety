# Goal

Want to finish notes on the first chapter of AIMA as part of establishing AI foundations.

(Can imagine that spending 49th week finishing first 2 chapters of AIMA for AI foundations. It seems deeper than some other resources like Hands on ML, or online courses.)

# Notes

(I just copy past them from remnote. I know pictures aren't visible on Github.)

Added notes on history of AI, was going into parts of it I deemed important/ didn't understand.

- History Of Artificial Intelligence
    - Inception of AI (1943-1956) 
        - Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts proposing artificial Neurons and showing that Neural Network can solve any Computable Function in 1940s is insane.

        - And Alan Turing realizing that Learning Algorithms are better than hand-crafted programs (i.e. literally Implicit Coding > Explicit Coding) is 1950 is just as impressive.

    - Expert Systems (1969-1986) 
        - Weak Methods ‒ an early approach in AI research, where problem-solving was done by a general search algorithm combining basic reasoning steps to find solutions. They were called weak because they didn't scale to large or difficult problems. (This was a search for Learning Algorithm, i.e. Implicit Coding.)
        - Expert Systems ‒ an opposite approach to Weak Methods, where domain knowledge is used for bigger reasoning steps, but in narrower areas of expertise. (Whereas this was a search for useful collection of heuristics that apply to some problem, i.e. Explicit Coding.)

        - Symbolic AI:
            - Logic is the problem-solving technique and symbols (things like cat, chair, dog, goal, numbers, letters...) are how we're going to represent the problem. 
            - A relation can be an adjective that describes a symbol, and we write it in front of the symbol: chocolate (donut). Relations can also be verbs: eat(jabril, donut)

    - Return of Neural Networks (1986-present) 
        - Reinvention of Backpropagation.
        - Connectionist models (i.e. Neural Networks) are seen as opposites to Symbolic AI/ Expert Systems. The difference is that Neural Networks can learn their own representations, and have them in hierarchies. In practice they also can find more complex transformations to those representations than Symbolic AI which is just disguised Explicit Coding with pre-specified representations (symbols).

        - Oh wow, Symbolic AI/ Expert Systems are Turing Complete ‒ which actually makes sense because this is just myriad of if/then loops nested similar to Explicit Coding! (In fact all Hardware computations are built on basic Logic Gates: AND, OR, NOT... !)
            - So when I think of Logic as too limiting to do complex stuff, I'm extremely mistaken because this is on what all Computation  is run ‒ I could've been more wrong!
            - The problem with Symbolic AI is that representations are too limiting, and that no human can hand-craft the complexity of some systems to make them work in practice, in principles they are fine.

    - One cannot miss the pattern in History Of Artificial Intelligence of: (1) some innovation happening, (2) it solving some genuine problems, (3) massive flux of investment based on real impact, (4) overpromise of this innovation solving "most problems under the sun", (5) disappointment in under-delivery of this innovation and massive investment outflux.
