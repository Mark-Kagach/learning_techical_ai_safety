After a bit more work, and mainly writing down on a piece of paper the chain-of-thought I used to explain ML, I realized I spend past two days basically explaining what computers are. Which is important and useful on its own, but I can save loads of time by just jumping straight to ML. Maybe I'll spend tomorrow broadly revisit computers and "explicit coding" to go to "implicit coding" once foundations are solid.![photo_5273871114373369115_y](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03ddd5a5-515c-40f0-9738-1c2291efa17c)
